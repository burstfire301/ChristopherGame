## Why Does Christopher Game Exist?
I wanted to make a game in Unity to learn about 3D graphics, game engines, C#, and git. I have since worked as a Computational Design Intern at Trimble Inc working with 3D graphics, C#, and git. Now I improve the game for fun and to practice what I have learned - both professionally and at university.
