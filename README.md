## Why Does Christopher Game Exist?
I wanted to make a game in Unity to learn about 3D graphics, game engines, C#, and git. I have since worked as a Computational Design Intern at Trimble Inc working with 3D graphics, C#, and git. Now I improve the game for fun and to practice what I have learned - both professionally and at university.

## Quick Start
1. clone the repo
2. open the project in unity
5. load the scene from the asset folder
6. click play button

## How to Play
1. use the arrow keys or wasd to move and jump
**_NOTE:_** spacebar is also jump
2. you can move while in the air
3. collect coins to gain a super jump
4. you can stack an unlimited number of super jumps
5. the goal is to help your character get from the first platform, to the final platform
good luck!

## Notes
1. if you fall off the platform, restart the game or it will fall forever
2. when you finish the game, manually end the game to exit

## Planned Features
1. ~~there is a platform underneath the player which catches them when they fall~~
2. there is a super jump counter
3. a player can complete the level
4. there is a timer from start to finish of a level
5. there is more than one level
6. the character model has some art
7. the player can choose to use super jump or regular jump
8. when the player reaches the end of a section, the camera rotates 90&deg to reveal the next section
